You don't have to pay huge tips as often smallest notes are appreciated. However, you do not have to tip if you feel that you haven't received any service or help at all or if you feel that the service was bad. Nobody will ever take offence or be disrespectful if you did not tip them.</p>\n<p>Most public toilets are staffed, and visitors are expected to tip the attendant. Some toilet attendants, especially at tourist sites, will dole out toilet paper based on the tip they receive. Foreigners may be especially susceptible to this, and although some locals ask or demand tips, they are often not warranted.</p>\n<p>There is no rule for what is considered tip-worthy, so one must be ready to hand out an Egyptian pound or two just in case, to use a toilet, for instance. For services such as tour guides or translators, a tip of 20% or more is generally expected. Taxi drivers provide service based upon agreed prices rather than the more objective meter system used in some other countries, so tipping is not expected when using a taxi service, though tips are certainly accepted if offered. Tips are expected at restaurants, and can range from a few pounds to 15%.</p>\n<p>If you ask a stranger for directions, tips are not necessary and may even be considered offensive. Officials in uniform, such as police officers, should not be tipped. Remember that bribery is illegal, but it is likely that nothing will happen to you. Be aware that as a foreign tourist, you are seen by many as easy money and you should <em>not</em> let yourself be pressured into tipping for unnecessary or unrequested \"services\" like self-appointed tour guides latching on to you.</p>\n<p>Some general guidelines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bathroom attendants</strong>: LE3</li>\n<li><strong>Cruises</strong>: LE30/day, to be divided by all staff on board</li>\n<li><strong>Guide</strong>: LE40/day</li>\n<li><strong>Hotel bellman</strong>: LE10 for all bags</li>\n<li><strong>Hotel doorman</strong>: LE10 for services rendered (such as flagging down taxis)</li>\n<li><strong>Restaurants</strong>: In fancier restaurants, a service charge (10-12%) is added to bills, but a 5-10% tip <em>on top of that</em> is common. In fast-food places, tipping is unnecessary</li>\n<li><strong>Taxi drivers</strong>: not necessary especially if you agreed the fare in advance, not more than 10% of the metered fare</li>\n<li><strong>Site custodians</strong>: LE5 if they do something useful, none otherwise</li>\n<li><strong>Tour drivers</strong>: LE10/day</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"path":"/egypt","title":"Egypt","author":"Joni","date":"2019-11-22","image":"egypt.jpg"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwABAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEBf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAHpMtouiI//xAAZEAEAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIhERL/2gAIAQEAAQUCx6iWK2dTZ//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASAf/aAAgBAwEBPwGcQ//EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS/9oACAECAQE/AaW//8QAFBABAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIP/aAAgBAQAGPwJf/8QAFxABAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARIf/aAAgBAQABPyESPTkCkUyW5dv/2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEM8v/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAER/9oACAEDAQE/EIMv/8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARD/2gAIAQIBAT8QXP8A/8QAGxABAAICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQBBESExUaH/2gAIAQEAAT8QVHsYhSmxqKZ0wIrAyoHh7P/Z","aspectRatio":1.4985022026431718,"src":"/static/31306bced9e6005ed6217d1def947c88/90537/egypt.jpg","srcSet":"/static/31306bced9e6005ed6217d1def947c88/b3ebb/egypt.jpg 270w,\n/static/31306bced9e6005ed6217d1def947c88/95b54/egypt.jpg 540w,\n/static/31306bced9e6005ed6217d1def947c88/90537/egypt.jpg 1080w,\n/static/31306bced9e6005ed6217d1def947c88/3cda3/egypt.jpg 1620w,\n/static/31306bced9e6005ed6217d1def947c88/1f682/egypt.jpg 2160w,\n/static/31306bced9e6005ed6217d1def947c88/0b65e/egypt.jpg 8504w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"image":"egypt.jpg"}}}
