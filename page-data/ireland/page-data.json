The same general rules apply as in the United Kingdom. It is usually not customary to tip a percentage of the total bill, a few small coins is generally considered quite polite. Like most of Europe it is common to round up to the nearest note, (i.e. paying €30 for a bill of €28).</p>\n<p>In restaurants tipping 10-15% is standard and for large groups or special occasions (wedding/anniversary/conference with banquet) tipping becomes part of the exuberance of the overall event and can be higher, indeed substantial. Tipping is not expected in bars or pubs and unnecessary in the rare bar or 'Superpub' that has toilet attendants. In taxis the fare is rounded off to the next euro for short city wide journeys, however this is more discretionary than in restaurants. In hotels a tip may be added to the bill on check out, however some guests prefer to tip individual waiters or room attendants either directly or leaving a nominal amount in the room.</p>\n<p>In all cases, the tip should express satisfaction with the level of service.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/ireland","title":"Ireland","author":"Joni","date":"2019-11-20","image":"ireland.jpg"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/static/a088a3efce7ff09354e58427c249400f/90537/ireland.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a088a3efce7ff09354e58427c249400f/b3ebb/ireland.jpg 270w,\n/static/a088a3efce7ff09354e58427c249400f/95b54/ireland.jpg 540w,\n/static/a088a3efce7ff09354e58427c249400f/90537/ireland.jpg 1080w,\n/static/a088a3efce7ff09354e58427c249400f/3cda3/ireland.jpg 1620w,\n/static/a088a3efce7ff09354e58427c249400f/1f682/ireland.jpg 2160w,\n/static/a088a3efce7ff09354e58427c249400f/a8d59/ireland.jpg 4032w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"image":"ireland.jpg"}}}
