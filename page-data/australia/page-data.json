You may, however, choose to leave a small tip if the service was exemplary. When paying by credit card, some higher end restaurants give the option of adding a tip to your payment, although it is completely optional. Other places provide a coin jar by the cashier labelled 'Tips', but more often than not, diners do not leave one. Bartenders are rarely tipped.</p>\n<p>Other types of service personnel, including hotel staff, porters, tour guides, food delivery drivers and hairdressers do not expect to receive tips.</p>\n<p>Tipping is also not expected in taxis, and drivers will typically return your change to the last 5 cents, unless you indicate that they should round the fare to the nearest dollar. It is not unusual for passengers to instruct the driver to round up to the next whole dollar.</p>\n<p>Casinos in Australia generally prohibit tipping of gaming staff, as it is considered bribery. Similarly, offering to tip government officials will usually be interpreted as bribery and can potentially be treated as a criminal offence.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/australia","title":"Australia","author":"Joni","date":"2019-11-22","image":"australia.jpg"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/57f3824f082a7baed860b52f8f1b9fc1/90537/australia.jpg","srcSet":"/static/57f3824f082a7baed860b52f8f1b9fc1/b3ebb/australia.jpg 270w,\n/static/57f3824f082a7baed860b52f8f1b9fc1/95b54/australia.jpg 540w,\n/static/57f3824f082a7baed860b52f8f1b9fc1/90537/australia.jpg 1080w,\n/static/57f3824f082a7baed860b52f8f1b9fc1/3cda3/australia.jpg 1620w,\n/static/57f3824f082a7baed860b52f8f1b9fc1/1f682/australia.jpg 2160w,\n/static/57f3824f082a7baed860b52f8f1b9fc1/cf34e/australia.jpg 5550w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"image":"australia.jpg"}}}
