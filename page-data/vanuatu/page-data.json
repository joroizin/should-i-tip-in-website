However, gifts are very appreciated and the exchange of gifts for services rendered fits well into the local traditions. Western governments have a hard time coming to terms with this practice as it is interpreted as bribery and corruption. But in the Melanesian culture, this practice is a normal way to do business... well the European colonisers introduced that \"cash\" stuff.</p>\n<p>A bag of rice to a village chief may be received with gratitude and dignity, but to offer triple the value in cash may be regarded as patronising, plus it will artificially inflate the price for the next traveller; set a wrong expectation, and rapidly destroy the genuine spontaneous friendship so easily given to you.</p>\n<p>A nice gesture is to give phone cards or a T-shirt, or school pads, pens, etc. for the children.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/vanuatu","title":"Vanuatu","author":"Joni","date":"2019-11-22","image":"vanuatu.jpg"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3329583802024747,"src":"/static/2ae5497547b6f8c2b1682a3413bc1611/90537/vanuatu.jpg","srcSet":"/static/2ae5497547b6f8c2b1682a3413bc1611/b3ebb/vanuatu.jpg 270w,\n/static/2ae5497547b6f8c2b1682a3413bc1611/95b54/vanuatu.jpg 540w,\n/static/2ae5497547b6f8c2b1682a3413bc1611/90537/vanuatu.jpg 1080w,\n/static/2ae5497547b6f8c2b1682a3413bc1611/3cda3/vanuatu.jpg 1620w,\n/static/2ae5497547b6f8c2b1682a3413bc1611/1f682/vanuatu.jpg 2160w,\n/static/2ae5497547b6f8c2b1682a3413bc1611/6885d/vanuatu.jpg 3555w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"image":"vanuatu.jpg"}}}
