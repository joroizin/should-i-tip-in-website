However, it is common for restaurants to levy a 10% service charge before GST, the local Goods and Services Tax. Restaurants often display prices like $19.99++, which means that service charge (10%) and sales tax (7%) are not included and will be added to your bill. When you see NETT, it means it includes all taxes and service charges.</p>\n<p>Bellhops and hotel porters still expect $2 or so per bag. Tipping is not expected in taxis, who usually return your change to the last 5 cents, or round the fare down by that amount in your favour, if they can't be bothered to dig for change; congestion or Electronic Road Pricing charges are often already included in the final fare. All taxis must advertise a hotline to call if the customer feels dissatisfied. Tipping is prohibited at the airport.</p>\n<p>Do <strong>not</strong> under any circumstances offer a tip to any government employee, especially police officers, as this is regarded as bribery, and would most likely get you arrested and pressed with criminal charges.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/singapore","title":"Singapore","author":"Joni","date":"2019-11-20","image":"singapore.jpg"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.2963438101347018,"src":"/static/e1cafa02b8013eb366d7e83dc303d3de/90537/singapore.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e1cafa02b8013eb366d7e83dc303d3de/b3ebb/singapore.jpg 270w,\n/static/e1cafa02b8013eb366d7e83dc303d3de/95b54/singapore.jpg 540w,\n/static/e1cafa02b8013eb366d7e83dc303d3de/90537/singapore.jpg 1080w,\n/static/e1cafa02b8013eb366d7e83dc303d3de/3cda3/singapore.jpg 1620w,\n/static/e1cafa02b8013eb366d7e83dc303d3de/1f682/singapore.jpg 2160w,\n/static/e1cafa02b8013eb366d7e83dc303d3de/bea28/singapore.jpg 4042w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"image":"singapore.jpg"}}}
