You will find some areas and businesses discourage it while others encourage it or there may be a neutral viewpoint about it. In popular tourist areas, in particular on Java and Bali, tipping is often hoped for. Tipping is certainly not a requirement in Indonesia, but if you feel you'd like to reward the person who helped you because they did a great job, or they made an extra effort then give it consideration if it is not openly discouraged. You can try asking people but you may not get a very clear answer. It is up to your discretion how much you give, Rp10,000 can buy a meal here, and in many occupations people may often struggle to make ends meet. In general, Indonesians themselves do not tip unless the service was exemplary. If you do tip, then ensure you give it directly to the person concerned, normally it is done by passing the money folded and in a slightly cupped right hand and placing directly into their own. This is done without flourish as though it were a quick light handshake, and normally without announcement, watch the locals, it is normally a quite discreet exchange.</p>\n<p>Also, in some cultures it is traditional to refuse something a few times (3 is a common number) before accepting it, but there are cultural nuances that can let you know whether it's politeness or a rejection of a tip.</p>\n<p>Finally, keep in mind that some people deliberately tell stories about how hard their life is in order to get a tip. If the person has offered these tales with little or no prompting, and has been quite detailed, you may wish to be cautious.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/indonesia","title":"Indonesia","author":"Joni","date":"2019-11-22","image":"indonesia.jpg"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/a40d80f03a4788df7a46f5a7aa19cc36/90537/indonesia.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a40d80f03a4788df7a46f5a7aa19cc36/b3ebb/indonesia.jpg 270w,\n/static/a40d80f03a4788df7a46f5a7aa19cc36/95b54/indonesia.jpg 540w,\n/static/a40d80f03a4788df7a46f5a7aa19cc36/90537/indonesia.jpg 1080w,\n/static/a40d80f03a4788df7a46f5a7aa19cc36/3cda3/indonesia.jpg 1620w,\n/static/a40d80f03a4788df7a46f5a7aa19cc36/1f682/indonesia.jpg 2160w,\n/static/a40d80f03a4788df7a46f5a7aa19cc36/39b3c/indonesia.jpg 5472w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"image":"indonesia.jpg"}}}
