Indeed, most of these businesses pay their staff the legal minimum-wage, relying on customer tips to bring staff incomes up to live-able levels. Tips of around <strong>10%</strong> of the bill are considered the norm but you may refuse to tip if the food and/or service were below par. Please note some restaurants management shares all \"official\" tips, you may want to rather give an actual cash tip to the waiter involved, instead of adding it to the bill being paid by cr/card.</p>\n<p>A small amount, usually around R5 or more, is given to petrol station attendants for additional services, such as cleaning one's windscreen. Toilet cleaners at service stations along major road routes are sometimes tipped when they provide good service and keep the facilities clean. \"Car guards\", who claim to \"look after\" one's parked car are often given a small tip if they are in uniform and authorized; however those without uniforms are usually regarded as a nuisance, and tipping them is not compulsory, despite the fact that they often harass motorists looking for payment.</p>\n<p>The 10% tipping rule also applies when taking a taxi. As most cabs work with cash only, it's better to ask how much you'll be expected to pay for your journey before getting in. This will ensure that you always have enough to give the driver as a tip.</p>\n<p>Lastly, when checking into your hotel, it is customary to tip your porter as well. The generally accepted rule is to give them R5 per bag they handle.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/south_africa","title":"South Africa","author":"Joni","date":"2019-11-22","image":"south_africa.jpg"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.499866345896819,"src":"/static/e930206cc3299343fbf0805d772a3596/90537/south_africa.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e930206cc3299343fbf0805d772a3596/b3ebb/south_africa.jpg 270w,\n/static/e930206cc3299343fbf0805d772a3596/95b54/south_africa.jpg 540w,\n/static/e930206cc3299343fbf0805d772a3596/90537/south_africa.jpg 1080w,\n/static/e930206cc3299343fbf0805d772a3596/3cda3/south_africa.jpg 1620w,\n/static/e930206cc3299343fbf0805d772a3596/1f682/south_africa.jpg 2160w,\n/static/e930206cc3299343fbf0805d772a3596/4ca5b/south_africa.jpg 5611w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"image":"south_africa.jpg"}}}
