As a result, you may find that waiters are not as attentive or courteous as you may be used to since they don't work for tips.  If you choose to tip, the tip amount in restaurants depends on your economic status, the locale and type of establishment. If you feel that you have experienced good service then leave some loose change on the table - possibly €1  or €2. If you don't, it is no big deal.</p>\n<p>Bars expect only tourists, particularly American tourists, to leave a tip. They are aware that it is customary in the United States to leave a tip for every drink or meal. It is rare to see anyone other than Americans tipping in Spain. In major resorts tipping may be common; look around at other diners to assess if tipping is appropriate.</p>\n<p>Outside the restaurant business, some service providers, such as taxi drivers, hairdressers and hotel personnel may expect a tip in an upscale setting.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/spain","title":"Spain","author":"Joni","date":"2019-11-20","image":"spain.jpg"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.4998431126451208,"src":"/static/b2bd65b1974f3bcf77fea189940e3fb7/90537/spain.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b2bd65b1974f3bcf77fea189940e3fb7/b3ebb/spain.jpg 270w,\n/static/b2bd65b1974f3bcf77fea189940e3fb7/95b54/spain.jpg 540w,\n/static/b2bd65b1974f3bcf77fea189940e3fb7/90537/spain.jpg 1080w,\n/static/b2bd65b1974f3bcf77fea189940e3fb7/3cda3/spain.jpg 1620w,\n/static/b2bd65b1974f3bcf77fea189940e3fb7/1f682/spain.jpg 2160w,\n/static/b2bd65b1974f3bcf77fea189940e3fb7/47929/spain.jpg 4780w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"image":"spain.jpg"}}}
