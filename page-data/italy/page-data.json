Most restaurants (with the notable exception of Rome) have a price for the service (called <strong>coperto</strong>) and waiters do not expect a tip, but they will not refuse it, especially if given by foreign customers. In caf√©s, bars, and pubs it's however not uncommon, on paying the bill, to leave the change saying to the waiter or to the cashier <strong>tenga il resto</strong> (\"keep the change\"). Tip jars near the cash register are becoming widespread, however in public restrooms is often forbidden. Leaving the change is also quite common with taxi drivers, and hotel porters may expect a little something. When using a credit card, it is not possible to add manually an amount to the bill, so it is possible to leave some notes as a tip.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/italy","title":"Italy","author":"Joni","date":"2019-11-20","image":"italy.jpg"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5001334400854016,"src":"/static/df45e91bf5f45119b828f41e08d5b43e/90537/italy.jpg","srcSet":"/static/df45e91bf5f45119b828f41e08d5b43e/b3ebb/italy.jpg 270w,\n/static/df45e91bf5f45119b828f41e08d5b43e/95b54/italy.jpg 540w,\n/static/df45e91bf5f45119b828f41e08d5b43e/90537/italy.jpg 1080w,\n/static/df45e91bf5f45119b828f41e08d5b43e/3cda3/italy.jpg 1620w,\n/static/df45e91bf5f45119b828f41e08d5b43e/1f682/italy.jpg 2160w,\n/static/df45e91bf5f45119b828f41e08d5b43e/21379/italy.jpg 5621w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"image":"italy.jpg"}}}
