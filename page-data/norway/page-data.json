Tipping should be given only as a token of real appreciation for the service.</p>\n<p>In Norway, like most of Europe, waiters are not dependent on tips from customers as they are in the US, as they are well paid. However, tipping is not unusual in mid- to high-end caf√©s and restaurants, but only if you feel you have been treated well. In restaurants, even though there is a service fee, rounding up is the norm, and 10% is considered generous. It is not normal to tip outside restaurants and bars, but in situations where change is common it is polite to leave the change (for example, taxis). Tipping cab drivers is usual if you travel for more than 200 kr, but you will get no reaction from the driver should you choose not to tip, so this may be a new experience to American and English tourists. Tipping is never considered offensive, but not tipping is also rarely frowned upon.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/norway","title":"Norway","author":"Joni","date":"2019-11-20","image":"norway.jpg"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/1123a17b6d87161e88fb8d2dc5499245/90537/norway.jpg","srcSet":"/static/1123a17b6d87161e88fb8d2dc5499245/b3ebb/norway.jpg 270w,\n/static/1123a17b6d87161e88fb8d2dc5499245/95b54/norway.jpg 540w,\n/static/1123a17b6d87161e88fb8d2dc5499245/90537/norway.jpg 1080w,\n/static/1123a17b6d87161e88fb8d2dc5499245/3cda3/norway.jpg 1620w,\n/static/1123a17b6d87161e88fb8d2dc5499245/1f682/norway.jpg 2160w,\n/static/1123a17b6d87161e88fb8d2dc5499245/39b3c/norway.jpg 5472w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"image":"norway.jpg"}}}
