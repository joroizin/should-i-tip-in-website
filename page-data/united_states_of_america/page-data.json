Standards vary, but gratuities are always given to servers in restaurants and bars, taxi drivers, parking valets, and bellstaff in hotels. The salaries made in these professions, and even their taxes, take into account that they will be tipped, so it really is inappropriate to leave them out.</p>\n<p>Tipping in the United States is so common and expected in some cases that in many service establishments, such as hair salons and restaurants, customers who did not tip are often asked to pay a tip, or in rare cases verbally scolded by staff for \"stiffing\" them.</p>\n<p>While Americans themselves often debate correct levels and exactly who deserves to be tipped, generally accepted standard rates are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Taxis</strong> — 10–20%. For livery cabs, if you hail the cab on the street and negotiate the fare in advance, then pay the negotiated amount plus an extra $1–2.</li>\n<li><strong>Shuttle bus drivers</strong> — $2–5</li>\n<li><strong>Private car &#x26; limousine drivers</strong> — 15–20%</li>\n<li><strong>Parking valet</strong> — $1–3 for retrieving your car (unless there's already a fee for parking)</li>\n<li><strong>Tour guides/activity guides</strong> — Between $5 and $10 depending on the size of the group (tips are lower in large groups), the cost of the tour, how funny/informative the guide was. </li>\n<li><strong>Full-service restaurants</strong> — 15–20%; tip higher (~20%) in higher-cost cities like New York and San Francisco. Many restaurants include a mandatory service charge for larger groups, in which case you do not need to tip an additional amount – check the bill.</li>\n<li><strong>Food delivery (pizza, etc.)</strong> — $2–5, 15–20% for larger orders</li>\n<li><strong>Bartenders</strong> — $1 per drink if inexpensive or 15–20% of total</li>\n<li><strong>Housekeeping in hotels</strong> — $1–2 per day for long stays or $5 minimum for very short stays</li>\n<li><strong>Porter, skycap, bellhop, hotel doorman</strong> — $1–2 per bag if they assist ($3–5 minimum), $1 for hailing a taxi or calling a cab</li>\n<li><strong>Hairdressers, masseuses, other personal services</strong> — 10–15%</li>\n<li><strong>Bicycle messengers</strong> — $3–5</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The legal minimum wage for restaurant waitstaff and other tip-earners is quite low (just $2.13/hour before taxes in some states<!-- https://www.dol.gov/whd/state/tipped.htm --> where minimums for other workers are $7.25 or more). Therefore, tipping for this service is regarded as even more essential. If you receive exceptionally poor or rude service and the manager does not correct the problem when you bring it to their attention, a deliberately small tip (one or two coins) will express your displeasure more clearly than leaving no tip at all (which may be construed as a forgotten tip).</p>\n<p>If paying your bill by cash, leave a cash tip on the table when you leave (there is no need to hand it over personally or wait until it's collected), or if paying by credit card you can add it directly to the charge slip when you sign it. Look carefully, as the slip will generally inform you whether a 15% gratuity has already been added.</p>\n<p>The rules for tipping at <strong>fast-food</strong> places are different and a bit more complicated. The key thing to remember is that tipping is associated with table service. The procedure at fast-food restaurants and when ordering takeout (even from what is otherwise a sit-down restaurant) is inherently self-service, therefore tipping is not necessary. Some eateries, mostly in the <strong>fast-casual</strong> sector, have a \"tip jar\" at the checkout station, but tipping in that scenario is purely optional, and you wouldn't be expected to contribute much more than the coins you're handed back as change. At <strong>cafeterias</strong> and <strong>buffets</strong>, a small tip is expected since staff often clear the table for you and provide refills of drinks and such.</p>\n<p>The rules for tipping <strong>concierges</strong> are also arcane. For most services — asking for maps, information, tours, etc. — a tip is not expected. But for things above and beyond like special, unusual, time-consuming requests, if you receive a lot of attention while others are waiting, or even just for an exceptionally high level of service, tips should generally be large, usually starting at $5 (a $1 tip would be insulting).</p>\n<p>Tipping well can make you look good in front of your American friends, dates and business partners, and could even earn you preferential treatment from staff, with the reverse also being true for tipping poorly.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/united_states_of_america","title":"USA","author":"Joni","date":"2019-11-21","image":"usa.jpg"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.25,"src":"/static/9c7e4ba4ef21eb5401308195a1900213/90537/usa.jpg","srcSet":"/static/9c7e4ba4ef21eb5401308195a1900213/b3ebb/usa.jpg 270w,\n/static/9c7e4ba4ef21eb5401308195a1900213/95b54/usa.jpg 540w,\n/static/9c7e4ba4ef21eb5401308195a1900213/90537/usa.jpg 1080w,\n/static/9c7e4ba4ef21eb5401308195a1900213/3cda3/usa.jpg 1620w,\n/static/9c7e4ba4ef21eb5401308195a1900213/1f682/usa.jpg 2160w,\n/static/9c7e4ba4ef21eb5401308195a1900213/7146c/usa.jpg 3000w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"image":"usa.jpg"}}}
