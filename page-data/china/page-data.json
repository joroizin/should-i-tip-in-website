While tipping would rarely be regarded as insulting, in some cases a tip might be seen as suggesting that a relationship is based on money, not friendship. When leaving a tip on your table, it is common to see a waiter chase after you to return the money you \"forgot\" to take.</p>\n<p>In China, compliments over service is usually expressed in implicit ways. If you are a smoker, you are expected to pass a cigarette to the service staff or manager. If you don't do so, you will be seen as selfish and egocentric. It is common to buy a bartender or pub owner a drink.</p>\n<p>In a hotel, it is customary not to tip for room service, airport service, taxis or anything else, although hotels that routinely serve foreign tourists may allow tipping for tour guides and associated drivers. Masseurs in some areas such as Shenzhen have been known to ask for a tip. However, if they become pushy at getting tips, most Chinese see this as extortion and an immoral practice, so just be firm if you don't wish to give any.</p>\n<p>Taxi drivers do appreciate a few yuan rounded up if they have made an extra effort for your journey; however, it is by no means required.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/china","title":"China","author":"Joni","date":"2019-11-22","image":"china.jpg"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/836c0163a5fee3697cc0d28d62ec0e2e/90537/china.jpg","srcSet":"/static/836c0163a5fee3697cc0d28d62ec0e2e/b3ebb/china.jpg 270w,\n/static/836c0163a5fee3697cc0d28d62ec0e2e/95b54/china.jpg 540w,\n/static/836c0163a5fee3697cc0d28d62ec0e2e/90537/china.jpg 1080w,\n/static/836c0163a5fee3697cc0d28d62ec0e2e/3cda3/china.jpg 1620w,\n/static/836c0163a5fee3697cc0d28d62ec0e2e/1f682/china.jpg 2160w,\n/static/836c0163a5fee3697cc0d28d62ec0e2e/0b354/china.jpg 6000w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"image":"china.jpg"}}}
