Tipping is a matter of personal choice, but visitors should take into account that locals usually do not leave a tip. Visitors should also know that it is common for bar and restaurant owners to keep some, or all, of the money given as tips.</p>\n<p>In cheaper restaurants, tipping is not expected at all and it will be considered unusual not to take all your change. In medium-to-upmarket restaurants, a 10% service charge is often compulsorily added to your bill. You may, at your own discretion, choose to tip on top of that if the service was exemplary; to give it more chance of reaching the staff, tips should be given in cash and not as additions to a credit card bill. It is also common for mid range Chinese restaurants to give you peanuts, tea and towels and add a small charge to the bill. Known as \"cha-sui money\" (money for tea and water), it is considered to be common practice, so unless the charge is excessive, tourists should accept it as part of the cost of the meal. Sometimes, restaurants will deliberately give customers change in coins, when notes could be given; it is your choice whether to take all your change or leave a small tip.</p>\n<p>Tipping is not expected in taxis but passengers will often round up the fare to the nearest dollar. During a typhoon, when any loss is not covered by insurance, a tip will be expected, or the taxi driver will ask you to pay a surcharge. In hotels, a guest is also expected to tip at least $10--20 for room service, and porters also expect $10--20 for carrying your bags. Bathroom attendants in luxury restaurants and clubs might also expect you to leave a few coins, but it's socially acceptable not to tip.</p>\n<p>Do not under any circumstances try to offer a tip to a government employee, especially police officers; this is regarded as bribery and is strictly illegal, and doing so will most probably result in you being arrested.</p>\n<p>Exceptionally, on important occasions, such as a wedding party or similar big gala event, local people hosting such events do tip substantially more than ten percent of the total bill. The money is put into a red envelope and given to the manager.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/hong_kong","title":"Hong Kong","author":"Joni","date":"2019-11-22","image":"hong_kong.jpg"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAMABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMFBv/EABYBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAv/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAABa/PmWuRAv//EABoQAQACAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAgMREhT/2gAIAQEAAQUCplCegjnNt0Olm5//xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERL/2gAIAQMBAT8BrT//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAECAQE/AT//xAAYEAACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASAxMv/aAAgBAQAGPwIoyof/xAAaEAADAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREhMYHR/9oACAEBAAE/IU1nlGlLun3Azk6YK6PTP//aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQJB//xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEf/aAAgBAwEBPxClP//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAEf/aAAgBAgEBPxBcsL//xAAcEAEAAwEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhMVFxkaH/2gAIAQEAAT8QEZUdXGUALKovIR38J+QEUDrO5HcvZ5Gcjvif/9k=","aspectRatio":1.6246266179887157,"src":"/static/e619c972cd351ceb35a0daaaaeaf25ca/90537/hong_kong.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e619c972cd351ceb35a0daaaaeaf25ca/b3ebb/hong_kong.jpg 270w,\n/static/e619c972cd351ceb35a0daaaaeaf25ca/95b54/hong_kong.jpg 540w,\n/static/e619c972cd351ceb35a0daaaaeaf25ca/90537/hong_kong.jpg 1080w,\n/static/e619c972cd351ceb35a0daaaaeaf25ca/3cda3/hong_kong.jpg 1620w,\n/static/e619c972cd351ceb35a0daaaaeaf25ca/1f682/hong_kong.jpg 2160w,\n/static/e619c972cd351ceb35a0daaaaeaf25ca/66ac6/hong_kong.jpg 4895w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"image":"hong_kong.jpg"}}}
