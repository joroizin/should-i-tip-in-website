Giving 5% to 10% of the total amount is common; more signals exceptionally good service. Rounding to a multiple of a Euro is common, for low sums the amount paid is often a multiple of 50 cents (i.e. a bill of 7.8 EUR can be paid as 8 EUR or 8.5 EUR).</p>\n<p>Tipping is not practised when the goods are exchanged over the counter (i.e. in fast-food restaurants or at street stalls). Traditionally, the owner of a restaurant does not receive a tip. A tip is known in the German language as <em>Trinkgeld</em>, which literally translates as 'money for drink'. It is also common practice to tip other service employees, like taxi drivers or hair dressers. Attempting to tip any kind of government employee may be perceived as a bribe and will get you in trouble.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/austria","title":"Austria","author":"Joni","date":"2019-11-22","image":"austria.jpg"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/20bd9e5313269f834157b1da606c9d8e/90537/austria.jpg","srcSet":"/static/20bd9e5313269f834157b1da606c9d8e/b3ebb/austria.jpg 270w,\n/static/20bd9e5313269f834157b1da606c9d8e/95b54/austria.jpg 540w,\n/static/20bd9e5313269f834157b1da606c9d8e/90537/austria.jpg 1080w,\n/static/20bd9e5313269f834157b1da606c9d8e/3cda3/austria.jpg 1620w,\n/static/20bd9e5313269f834157b1da606c9d8e/1f682/austria.jpg 2160w,\n/static/20bd9e5313269f834157b1da606c9d8e/0b354/austria.jpg 6000w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"image":"austria.jpg"}}}
