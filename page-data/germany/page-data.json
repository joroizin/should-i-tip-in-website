Whilst not mandatory, it is always appreciated as a thanks for excellent service. Tips rarely exceed 10% of the bill (including tax) and tips are also rather common when the bill is an uneven amount to avoid having to deal with small change (e.g. a bill of €13.80 will commonly be rounded up to €15 to make making change easier). The server will never propose this and even when dealing with one of the annoying €x.99 prices, they will diligently search for the copper coins to make change unless you say otherwise.</p>\n<p>Unlike in some other countries, service staff are always paid by the hour and the minimum wage of €9.19 an hour (as of 2019) applies to service staff as well as any other profession. However, service staff is more likely to get only the minimum wage or barely above even in establishments where other jobs get higher wages. A tip is therefore mainly a matter of politeness and shows your appreciation. If you didn't appreciate the service (e.g. slow, snippy or indifferent service) you may not tip at all and it will be accepted by the staff. Americans in particular are known among service staff for being generous tippers pretty much regardless of service, so they may be a lesser priority on busy days in some places.</p>\n<p>Tipping in Germany is usually done by mentioning the total while paying. So if e.g. a waiter tells you the bill amounts to \"€13.50\", just state \"15\" and s/he will include a tip of €1.50. Alternatively, if you wish to ask them to keep the change, you may say <em>\"Stimmt so!\"</em> or simply <em>\"Danke!\"</em>. </p>\n<p>Tipping in other situations (unless otherwise indicated):\n*Taxi driver: 5–10% (at least €1)\n*Housekeeping: €1–2 per day\n*Carrying luggage: €1 per piece\n*Delivery services: 5–10% (at least €1)</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/germany","title":"Germany","author":"Joni","date":"2019-11-20","image":"germany.jpg"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.4991929905464607,"src":"/static/23c0bc8a23dfd27c69a139b90a97b144/90537/germany.jpg","srcSet":"/static/23c0bc8a23dfd27c69a139b90a97b144/b3ebb/germany.jpg 270w,\n/static/23c0bc8a23dfd27c69a139b90a97b144/95b54/germany.jpg 540w,\n/static/23c0bc8a23dfd27c69a139b90a97b144/90537/germany.jpg 1080w,\n/static/23c0bc8a23dfd27c69a139b90a97b144/3cda3/germany.jpg 1620w,\n/static/23c0bc8a23dfd27c69a139b90a97b144/1f682/germany.jpg 2160w,\n/static/23c0bc8a23dfd27c69a139b90a97b144/6abc8/germany.jpg 6502w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"image":"germany.jpg"}}}
