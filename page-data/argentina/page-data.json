Some restaurants already charge customers with \"cubiertos\" (table service). In these cases tipping is not expected. Sometimes rounding up or telling them to \"keep the change\" is enough on small checks, deliveries, gasoline tenders, etc. Leaving at least a 10% tip is considered kind and polite at restaurants, cafes, hotels, beauty parlors, barbers, ushers and car-washes. Tipping bartenders is not customary. Leaving no tip when feeling unsatisfied is not an uncommon gesture, and it's interpreted as such. Taxi drivers do not expect to be tipped.</p>\n<p>Another local custom is to tip the ushers in theatres and opera houses when they're also in charge of handing out the programmes; one may request one without tipping, at the risk of being considered cheap.</p>\n<p>Service fees are included in most upscale hotels and restaurants, usually around 15%. These fees can appear in the menu as \"valor del cubierto\", \"servicio\", or simply \"cubierto\". By law it is mandatory that this item is represented in the same text size as the rest of the menu items.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/argentina","title":"Argentina","author":"Joni","date":"2019-11-22","image":"argentina.jpg"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.4997000599880024,"src":"/static/b1ca1c8a678b383a3bfad7dc0aedea33/90537/argentina.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b1ca1c8a678b383a3bfad7dc0aedea33/b3ebb/argentina.jpg 270w,\n/static/b1ca1c8a678b383a3bfad7dc0aedea33/95b54/argentina.jpg 540w,\n/static/b1ca1c8a678b383a3bfad7dc0aedea33/90537/argentina.jpg 1080w,\n/static/b1ca1c8a678b383a3bfad7dc0aedea33/3cda3/argentina.jpg 1620w,\n/static/b1ca1c8a678b383a3bfad7dc0aedea33/1f682/argentina.jpg 2160w,\n/static/b1ca1c8a678b383a3bfad7dc0aedea33/dd1a0/argentina.jpg 2500w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"image":"argentina.jpg"}}}
