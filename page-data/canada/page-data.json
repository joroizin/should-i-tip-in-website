Restaurant wait staff in Canada typically receive about 10-15% on the before-tax total. Tipping is not appropriate in cafeterias, fast food establishments and takeaway stands; one is not normally expected to tip hotel chambermaids. Once Canada's double-digit sales taxes and a tip are factored into the cost of a restaurant meal, the tab may often be 25% or more above the price indicated on the menu.</p>\n<p>Some provinces (including Quebec and Ontario) allow employers to pay lower minimum wages to workers who would reasonably be expected to be receiving tips. As well, often a bar or restaurant will try to tack on a 15-18% tip themselves, so large groups and clients paying by credit card should check to see whether their bill already includes a \"service charge\" before giving twice.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/canada","title":"Canada","author":"Joni","date":"2019-11-22","image":"canada.jpg"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUCAwT/xAAWAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQL/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAcrFLexMXC//xAAbEAACAwADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgADERMUIv/aAAgBAQABBQKlys7GK142tpynGPr/xAAXEQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAhBB/9oACAEDAQE/AS2T/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAER/9oACAECAQE/AY1//8QAGhAAAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECIRAxkf/aAAgBAQAGPwKuFxNYQz//xAAcEAEBAAEFAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhMVFhgbH/2gAIAQEAAT8hd2pykB99LL1h9nDdM6l//9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABBkH//EABcRAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESH/2gAIAQMBAT8QXeINL//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERAP/aAAgBAgEBPxCAq6t//8QAHRABAQEAAQUBAAAAAAAAAAAAAREAITFBUWGh4f/aAAgBAQABPxBO9pU6+55z0AJbwXzDgEvEfzEGDDmTElzpECu//9k=","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/530d4ded63f1dfc8f358828cf5259f20/90537/canada.jpg","srcSet":"/static/530d4ded63f1dfc8f358828cf5259f20/b3ebb/canada.jpg 270w,\n/static/530d4ded63f1dfc8f358828cf5259f20/95b54/canada.jpg 540w,\n/static/530d4ded63f1dfc8f358828cf5259f20/90537/canada.jpg 1080w,\n/static/530d4ded63f1dfc8f358828cf5259f20/3cda3/canada.jpg 1620w,\n/static/530d4ded63f1dfc8f358828cf5259f20/1f682/canada.jpg 2160w,\n/static/530d4ded63f1dfc8f358828cf5259f20/e7c7e/canada.jpg 5760w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"image":"canada.jpg"}}}
