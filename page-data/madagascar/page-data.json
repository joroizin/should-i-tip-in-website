In restaurants and bars you should leave a tip equivalent to ten percent of the total bill. Locals will generally leave far less. If someone helps you with your bags consider a tip equivalent to US$1 per bag. In taxis, rounding the bill upwards is more than sufficient. If you have a private vehicle with a driver, tipping the equivalent of US$10-13 per day is considered extremely generous, while US$5-10 per day is normal for standard service. A good tip for a park guide is approximately US$7-10 per day. Individuals who clean hotel rooms are sometimes not given a salary, so consider leaving a few dollars in the room when you depart (many hotels will have a tip box in the lobby that can also be used to tip the entire staff). When in doubt about how much to tip, consider that even a doctor or university teacher may be making less than 200,000 Ar per month, and remember that in remote areas your tip may set expectations for travelers who follow you, some of whom may be researchers or aid workers with limited funds available.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/madagascar","title":"Madagascar","author":"Joni","date":"2019-11-22","image":"madagascar.jpg"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/f7b72491d10cc10c069f54734b9e9826/90537/madagascar.jpg","srcSet":"/static/f7b72491d10cc10c069f54734b9e9826/b3ebb/madagascar.jpg 270w,\n/static/f7b72491d10cc10c069f54734b9e9826/95b54/madagascar.jpg 540w,\n/static/f7b72491d10cc10c069f54734b9e9826/90537/madagascar.jpg 1080w,\n/static/f7b72491d10cc10c069f54734b9e9826/3cda3/madagascar.jpg 1620w,\n/static/f7b72491d10cc10c069f54734b9e9826/1f682/madagascar.jpg 2160w,\n/static/f7b72491d10cc10c069f54734b9e9826/39b3c/madagascar.jpg 5472w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"image":"madagascar.jpg"}}}
