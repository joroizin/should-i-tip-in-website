It is usually from 10 to 15%.</p>\n<p>Meals have a 10% to 15% tip (this includes fast food deliveries). This tip is usually left by most people in restaurants, although it is not so common in street restaurants or stands, where the tenders usually have a can or box where people deposit coins.</p>\n<p>It is generally common to leave a tip on the table after paying and therefore having small change is very useful.</p>\n<p>In Mexican bars and night clubs it is often seen that they charge directly into the bill the 15% of the total amount (taxes included). That is illegal in most cases because of the imposition of the tip and because they calculate the 15% with taxes included. In large groups, or in nightclubs the barmen expect the customers to deposit their tip in a cup left on the table before serving the drinks so the service they give is in function with the tip they received.</p>\n<p>It is also customary to give a tip to the person who sometimes guard the car as if they were valet parking; in Mexico these people are often called \"viene viene\" (literally: \"comes, comes\") or franeleros and usually people give them M$3-20 depending on the zone, although they sometimes ask for bigger sums of money when the car is left close to a night life area.</p>\n<p>In medium and large retail stores such as Wal-Mart there are uniformed helpers, usually children or the elderly, who bag the products just after the clerk has scanned them. This role is called cerillo (Spanish for \"match\"). It is common for these helpers to not have a basic salary, so all the money earned is from the tips people give them. Most customers give M$2-5 depending on the number of products. Cerillos also put the bags in the cart and if the load is large they can even help bringing it to the car and unloading the bags; in these cases, they normally receive more than M$15.</p>\n<p>Tipping is not expected in cabs or buses, except when it is a tour. In some populated Mexican restaurants wandering musicians enter, play, and expect the customers to pay something, although this is voluntary. In filling stations, the workers usually get M$2-5 for every gasoline load. In stadiums people give a small tip to the person who shows the place where they should sit. Tips are also given to bellboys, barbers and people that work in similar services.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/mexico","title":"Mexico","author":"Joni","date":"2019-11-22","image":"mexico.jpg"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/8b769be42b8330f255685701879e691e/90537/mexico.jpg","srcSet":"/static/8b769be42b8330f255685701879e691e/b3ebb/mexico.jpg 270w,\n/static/8b769be42b8330f255685701879e691e/95b54/mexico.jpg 540w,\n/static/8b769be42b8330f255685701879e691e/90537/mexico.jpg 1080w,\n/static/8b769be42b8330f255685701879e691e/3cda3/mexico.jpg 1620w,\n/static/8b769be42b8330f255685701879e691e/1f682/mexico.jpg 2160w,\n/static/8b769be42b8330f255685701879e691e/0b354/mexico.jpg 6000w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"image":"mexico.jpg"}}}
