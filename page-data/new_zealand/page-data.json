Do not be surprised or offended if you receive bemused looks or if your tip is refused or questioned, as New Zealanders themselves generally do not tip, and it is also a form of courtesy in New Zealand culture to first decline such a gesture before accepting it. Despite this, some forms of tipping are common, such as rounding up a taxi fare. It is almost as likely, however, that the taxi driver will round the fare down to the nearest dollar. Some caf√©s keep a jar on the counter marked \"tips for staff\", in which customers can leave small change, though more often than not, locals do not leave any.</p>\n<p>Restaurants are generally required to include the cost of service and taxes in posted prices. However, it is legal for restaurants to impose a surcharge on top the posted prices during public holidays, as they are required to pay their employees higher wages on those days.</p>\n<p>Occasionally tips are given in a restaurant for exceptional service, particularly in the larger cities like Christchurch, Wellington and Auckland. But in these cities it is becoming quite common for bar staff to be given tips of around 30 dollars built up over the whole night, especially the waiting staff. Again this is not a percentage amount of the bill but just a goodwill gesture by the patrons. Others may feel that the people who do this are being ostentatious and showing off their wealth. New Zealanders travelling overseas often find the custom difficult and confusing. It is common practice and polite to donate your spare change from the meal to what ever charity has a collection jar on the counter, and this acts as the standard substitute for tipping.</p>\n<p>However, many New Zealanders travel and live in other countries, often returning to New Zealand and bringing the tipping habit back with them. In general, people who perform a service in New Zealand, such as waiters and hairdressers, are tipped with a smile and a thank you instead of money. This is considered reasonable because their average wage is substantially larger than their American counterparts.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/new_zealand","title":"New Zealand","author":"Joni","date":"2019-11-22","image":"new_zealand.jpg"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5001585791309864,"src":"/static/2f74dcc16b5706d69436abd7f59c4142/90537/new_zealand.jpg","srcSet":"/static/2f74dcc16b5706d69436abd7f59c4142/b3ebb/new_zealand.jpg 270w,\n/static/2f74dcc16b5706d69436abd7f59c4142/95b54/new_zealand.jpg 540w,\n/static/2f74dcc16b5706d69436abd7f59c4142/90537/new_zealand.jpg 1080w,\n/static/2f74dcc16b5706d69436abd7f59c4142/3cda3/new_zealand.jpg 1620w,\n/static/2f74dcc16b5706d69436abd7f59c4142/1f682/new_zealand.jpg 2160w,\n/static/2f74dcc16b5706d69436abd7f59c4142/46866/new_zealand.jpg 4730w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"image":"new_zealand.jpg"}}}
