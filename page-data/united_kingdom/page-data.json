In many restaurants with table service, a 'service charge' on your bill replaces a tip; in the absence of a service charge, a tip of about 10-15% is customary. It is less usual to tip in cafés and coffee shops. Many restaurants will allow tips to be added to a credit card bill, but it is generally considered better to leave cash at the table. The reason for this is that cash is deemed to have been given to the waiting staff directly, whilst credit card payments and cheques are legally payable to the restaurant. While a tip given by credit card or cheque will almost always be passed on to the waiting staff it is up to the management how they are shared. Staff be paid the minimum wage before any tips.</p>\n<p>It is not normal to tip for drinks in a pub or bar, although offering to buy the bartender a drink is considered acceptable and they may also then take money for the value of a drink (which is in effect taking a tip). Commonly, this is offered by saying \"and one for yourself\" at the time of payment. In cases where the pub is also a restaurant, the serving staff may be tipped.</p>\n<p>Although not tipping as such, you may in some pubs and venues encounter the 'charity box' (or bucket, bottle or other container). Typically these will have the name of the benefiting cause clearly marked. If you feel generous, and agree with the charity's aims, you can add some spare change, but there's no obligation.</p>\n<p>In many table-service restaurants – and gastro pubs – a 'service charge' is added to the bill, usually when the party exceeds a certain size, e.g. six, in which case there is no expectation to tip further. It's worth checking the menu when ordering, for information on service charges.</p>\n<p>It is a legal requirement to post prices including any taxes and other charges. Additional service charges at restaurants are unusual. Where these occur, it is legal to refuse to pay the service charge but people only tend to do this if they believe the service was inadequate.</p>\n<p>Tipping is generally not expected in taxis, though it is usual for passengers to round the fare up a convenient amount, such as the next whole pound, or a convenient denomination of bank note. If you have a lot of luggage and the driver helps you out with it, a tip of £2-3 would be customary.</p>\n<p>Historically, offering a tip may have been seen as an insult; it is implying the receiver may be bought or bribed, and that the person doing the tipping is \"better than you\". This is the origin of the custom of offering to buy the barman/barmaid a drink in a pub. You would not tip a friend or work colleague, that would be an insult, but it is normal to buy them a drink.</p>\n<p>In some establishments, tips are kept individually by the waiter or waitress, whereas in others they may be pooled and divided amongst all the staff (a 'tronc'). In other instances, tips may be set aside for some other purpose for the benefit of the staff, such as to fund a staff party or trip.</p>\n<p>Tipping for other services such as taxis, pizza deliveries and hairdressers is not expected, but tips are sometimes given to reward particularly good service. In some large cities it is customary to tip hairdressers/barbers.</p>\n<p>Any attempt to tip a policeman or other public-sector worker can be regarded as bribery and could be treated as a criminal offence.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/united_kingdom","title":"United Kingdom","author":"Joni","date":"2019-11-22","image":"united_kingdom.jpg"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5001497454327644,"src":"/static/42d8c9256b12725510ef0d61aa0fa807/90537/united_kingdom.jpg","srcSet":"/static/42d8c9256b12725510ef0d61aa0fa807/b3ebb/united_kingdom.jpg 270w,\n/static/42d8c9256b12725510ef0d61aa0fa807/95b54/united_kingdom.jpg 540w,\n/static/42d8c9256b12725510ef0d61aa0fa807/90537/united_kingdom.jpg 1080w,\n/static/42d8c9256b12725510ef0d61aa0fa807/3cda3/united_kingdom.jpg 1620w,\n/static/42d8c9256b12725510ef0d61aa0fa807/1f682/united_kingdom.jpg 2160w,\n/static/42d8c9256b12725510ef0d61aa0fa807/ae19a/united_kingdom.jpg 5009w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"image":"united_kingdom.jpg"}}}
