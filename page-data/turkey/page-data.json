However, it is very common to leave a 5% to 10% tip in restaurants if you're satisfied with the service. At high-end restaurants a tip of 10-15% is customary. It is NOT possible to add tip to the credit card bill. It is very common amongst Turkish people to pay the bill with a credit card and leave the tip in cash or coins. Most waiters will bring your cash back in coins as much as possible, that's because Turkish people don't like to carry coins around and usually leave them at the table.</p>\n<p>Taxi drivers do not expect tips, but it is common practice to let them keep the change. If you insist on taking exact change back, ask for <em>para üstü?</em> (pronounced \"pah-rah oos-too\", which means \"change\"). Driver will be reluctant to give it at first, but you will eventually succeed.</p>\n<p>If you are fortunate enough to try out a Turkish bath, it is customary to tip 15% of the total and split it up among all of the attendants. This is an important thing to keep in mind when tipping in Turkey, and will ensure your experience goes smoothly and is enjoyable.</p>\n<p>Supermarket cashiers usually round up the total sum to the next 5 kuruş if you pay in cash (the exact sum is extracted when paid by a credit card though). This is not a kind of involuntary tip, as the 2-3-4 kuruşes don't go into their pockets. It is simply because they are not adequately supplied with enough 1 kuruş coins as it is very rare in circulation. So don't be surprised if the change given to you is short of a few kuruşes from what should be given to you according to what the electronic board of the till says. It is totally okay to pay the exact sum if you have enough number of 1 kuruş coins.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/turkey","title":"Turkey","author":"Joni","date":"2019-11-22","image":"turkey.jpg"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.4369081136421806,"src":"/static/e14da4df24027d6d3c8c8a1a99c1a410/90537/turkey.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e14da4df24027d6d3c8c8a1a99c1a410/b3ebb/turkey.jpg 270w,\n/static/e14da4df24027d6d3c8c8a1a99c1a410/95b54/turkey.jpg 540w,\n/static/e14da4df24027d6d3c8c8a1a99c1a410/90537/turkey.jpg 1080w,\n/static/e14da4df24027d6d3c8c8a1a99c1a410/3cda3/turkey.jpg 1620w,\n/static/e14da4df24027d6d3c8c8a1a99c1a410/1f682/turkey.jpg 2160w,\n/static/e14da4df24027d6d3c8c8a1a99c1a410/559d5/turkey.jpg 5614w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"image":"turkey.jpg"}}}
