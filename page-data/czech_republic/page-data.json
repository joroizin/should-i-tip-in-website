It is common to round up the bill by a few crowns to make it even. Away from places regularly visited by foreigners, leaving a \"tip\" on a table after a meal at a restaurant is not the usual practice; locals may even object to it.</p>\n<p>Tipping in tourist restaurants is a standard 10%, and is not normally added to the bill. Don't be confused by the percentage figures listed at the bottom of the bill - by Czech law, a receipt must show the VAT paid (21% in most cases) - the VAT is already included in the final amount, and you should add 10% to this. It is normal practice to give the waiter the tip <strong>before</strong> you leave the table. Tipping is <em>not</em> obligatory - if you weren't satisfied with services offered, don't bother tipping.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/czech_republic","title":"Czech Republic","author":"Joni","date":"2019-11-22","image":"czech_republic.jpg"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/d5b2c8351631829091e1dabcb20a7e4c/90537/czech_republic.jpg","srcSet":"/static/d5b2c8351631829091e1dabcb20a7e4c/b3ebb/czech_republic.jpg 270w,\n/static/d5b2c8351631829091e1dabcb20a7e4c/95b54/czech_republic.jpg 540w,\n/static/d5b2c8351631829091e1dabcb20a7e4c/90537/czech_republic.jpg 1080w,\n/static/d5b2c8351631829091e1dabcb20a7e4c/3cda3/czech_republic.jpg 1620w,\n/static/d5b2c8351631829091e1dabcb20a7e4c/1f682/czech_republic.jpg 2160w,\n/static/d5b2c8351631829091e1dabcb20a7e4c/0b354/czech_republic.jpg 6000w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"image":"czech_republic.jpg"}}}
